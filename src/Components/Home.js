        When starting a React project, a simple HTML page with script tags might
        still be the best option. It only takes a minute to set up! As your
        application grows, you might want to consider a more integrated setup.
        There are several JavaScript toolchains we recommend for larger
        applications. Each of them can work with little to no configuration and
        lets you take full advantage of the rich React ecosystem.
